Sucker love is heaven sent
You pucker up our passion's spent
My heart's a tart your body's rent
My body's broken, yours is spent
Carve your name into my arm
Instead of stressed I lie here charmed
'Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Sucker love a box I choose
No other box I choose to use
Another love I would abuse
No circumstances could excuse
