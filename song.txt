Sucker love is heaven sent
You pucker up our passion's spent
My heart's a tart your body's rent
My body's broken, yours is spent
Carve your name into my arm
Instead of stressed I lie here charmed
'Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Sucker love a box I choose
No other box I choose to use
Another love I would abuse
No circumstances could excuse
In the shape of things to come
Too much poison come undone
'Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me
Sucker love is known to swing
Prone to cling and waste these things
Pucker up for heaven's sake
There's never been so much at stake
I serve my head up on a plate
It's only comfort, calling late
'Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me
